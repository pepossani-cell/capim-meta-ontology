# Agent & Workflow Protocol

## 1. Workflow Execution
- Workflows are stored in `.agent/workflows/`.
- Steps marked with `// turbo` can be auto-executed.
- Always ask for confirmation on destructive steps unless marked `SafeToAutoRun`.

## 2. Skill Usage
- Skills in `.agent/skills/` extend capabilities.
- Before using a skill, read its `SKILL.md` to understand inputs/outputs.
- Prefer creating reusable python scripts in `scripts/` over one-off shell commands.

## 3. Context Awareness
- When running a workflow, load the relevant `ONTOLOGY_INDEX_*.yaml` into context to understand domain boundaries.
